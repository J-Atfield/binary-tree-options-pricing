# binary-tree-options-pricing

## TODO:
- Add underlying parameter to option class
- fit volatility based on historical data for underlying (possible extension: stochastic vol?)
- cleanup classes and code (remove redundant stuff, move unneccesary bits from option into tree etc.)
- dashboard?
- docs?
